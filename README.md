# 1X3-Router-design-verification-and-code-coverage
A router is one of the most important communication back bone in NoC. In technological era, VLSI industry found a paradigm called SOC but after seeking major disadvantages in SOC like underutilization of cores, poor reusability, high complexity, poor scalability, etc., they found a new paradigm called NOC (Network-on-chip) to overcome the disadvantages of SOC. Router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It is an OSI layer 3 routing device. It drives an incoming packet to an output channel based on the address field contained in the packet header. A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks (as opposed to a network switch, which connects data lines from one single network).  When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing  policy,  it  directs  the  packet  to  the  next  network  on  its  journey.  This creates an overlay internetwork. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node.
